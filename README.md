# hello-world
They made me do it.

Hi there....yes i'm speaking to you.

You're clearly here for a reason, i'm assuming it's to find out a bit about me.
I'm a student studying software engineering and I am diving into the depths of the internet by means of programming, I'm using github as a place where I can practice coding and increase my proficiency in programming; specifically javascript and python.
I'm going to take a look at react.native now.

Adios amigos.
