# hello-world
They made me do it.

When I'm not advancing my dev skills, im usually off somewhere sweating (gym or running) or eating good food.

I'm a student studying software engineering and I am diving into the depths of the internet by means of programming, I'm using github as a place where I can practice coding and increase my proficiency in programming; specifically javascript and python.
I'm going to take a look at react.native now.

Adios.
